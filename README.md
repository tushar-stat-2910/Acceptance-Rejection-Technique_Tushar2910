# Acceptance-Rejection-Technique_Tushar2910
Acceptance-Rejection Technique is to simulate a random variables which have complicated mathematical probability distribution.

In Statistical computing paper I experienced so many statistical techniques, out of them one technique is fascinated me was "Acceptance-Rejection Technique".
The purpose of this techniques is to simulate a random variables which have complicated mathematical probability distribution which can't be simulated analytically, we can simulate it by using a probability distribution from which we can generate random numbers easily (i.e. from well known probability distributions). 
As we all know while studying any real life processes we come across such a situation where we fitted a model, to study (various properties) such a model by conducting repeated trials we needs random numbers. If the fitted model is belongs to family of well known probability distribution then generating random numbers is not a problem but problem occurs when it's not that.
To generate random numbers from such a model we use A-R technique.
The General Procedure of A-R technique is explained in book "Simulation by Sheldon & Ross".
